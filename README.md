## General Information
### Backgound
Low digital health literacy remains a problem in Africa. It stands to reason that the most obvious approach to addressing low health literacy is making information more accessible. Without accessible information, there is no basis by which individuals or a community can process messages to improve health outcomes. With internet penetration at 51% in Nigeria and lower in some other African countries, there is a need to innovate around getting health messages across to communities without internet services and improving their health literacy.

### Proposed Solution
A USSD-Based mobile health educational tool that members subscribe to and select the types of messages theyâ€™d like to receive.


### Long-term solution
We hypothesise that if the proposed solution is successful, we could improve digital literacy access to the communities we serve.

1. Once you have installed XAMPP, please navigte to your program folders and select the XAMPP folder
2. Inside the XAMMP folder select htdocs
3. Open your terminal and git clone this repo in the htdocs directory ```git clone https://****************************************```
4. Move into the the newly cloned repo using the ```cd``` command
5. Inside your new directory run , ```npm install```  to install any javascript dependencies
6. Also, run the composer install to install any PHP libraries
7. Then navigate to phpMyAdmin on your local machine  and create a new database called 'healthussd'
8. Select the newly created database and import sql dump(link provide below)
9. After this , head over to the xammp control and start Apacher and MySQL to run the application on yout local machine
